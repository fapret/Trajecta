# About the Project
The **Tmde app curricula** project originated from the Model-Driven Engineering Workshop course, developed using tools like Eclipse, Java, and Ecore. The project was initially created by [@fapret](https://github.com/fapret) and [@sfreirelp](https://github.com/sfreirelp), and is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license for public use.

The goal of the project is to create an application utilizing Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to assist students throughout their academic journey, especially by helping them understand which courses they can take, thus providing better guidance and offering a retrospective view of their academic career.

During development, the project focused on how the University of the Republic (UdelaR) operates, specifically the Computer Engineering program, though it is expected to work for other degree programs as well.
